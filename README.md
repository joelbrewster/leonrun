# Leon, run!

- This is a silly roguelike-ish random level collect stuff sort of game.
  - The point is to avoid the red @ (Dad) and find the aqua @'s (Leon) favorite toy.
  - If "Dad" catches you it's game over.
  - If you find Leon's favorite truck, you win.


There's many bugs and it needs a lot of work.
- I plan to add a shadow around the player so they can only see what they've discovered.
- I plan to add 'scenes' for the gameplay; start, game over, win.
